# Origins: Math Mod

Mod link: https://modrinth.com/mod/origins-math (Status: under review)

This is the GitHub repo for the Origins: Math mod.

Wanna get started? You can visit the [documentation](https://origins-math.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)! Almost everything you need should be there.

Wanna report a bug? You can use GitHub's issue tracker! Make sure to search for existing issues first, I don't really wanna run into duplicate issues. It would be really helpful if you can provide:
- Mods that you were using
- Your Minecraft version
- The version of Origins: Math you were using
- What should happen, and what happened instead. (Screenshots are really useful here!)
- A client and/or server log. Don't forget to add a label! It helps me classify your issue more easily.

Wanna create a PR? Go ahead, improvements are greatly appreciated!
